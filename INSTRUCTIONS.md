Overview
In this assignment, you will build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web application that allows users to search through a collection of documents about a topic of your choice using semantic search. You will then deploy it live on Render.com so anyone can access it.

This assignment ties together everything you have learned over the past three days: text processing, embeddings, vector databases, web applications, and deployment.

Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:

Apply chunking strategies to prepare documents for embedding
Use LangChain and ChromaDB to build a vector database
Build an interactive web application with Streamlit
Deploy a real application using Git, GitHub, and Render.com
Document and present your work professionally
What You Will Build
A Streamlit web application with:

At least 10 documents/texts about your chosen topic
Semantic search functionality (user types a question, app returns relevant chunks)
At least 2 pages (Home + Search, optionally more)
A clean, user-friendly interface
Topic Ideas
Pick a topic you find interesting! Here are some ideas to get you started:

Academic
A specific university course (e.g., Introduction to Psychology, Linear Algebra)
A scientific field (e.g., quantum physics, marine biology, neuroscience)
Historical events (e.g., the Space Race, the Renaissance, ancient civilizations)
Famous scientists and their discoveries
Hobbies & Lifestyle
Recipes from a specific cuisine (e.g., Italian, Japanese, Mexican)
Rules and strategies for a sport (e.g., basketball, chess, climbing)
Video game guides or lore (e.g., Zelda, Minecraft, League of Legends)
Music theory fundamentals (scales, chords, rhythm)
Fitness exercises and workout plans
Professional & Technical
A programming language or framework (e.g., Python, React, SQL)
Design principles (UI/UX, graphic design, typography)
Business and startup concepts (lean methodology, marketing, finance)
Cybersecurity fundamentals
Fun & Creative
Movie plots or film analysis (e.g., Studio Ghibli, Marvel, Nolan films)
Book summaries from your favorite genre
Travel guides for countries or cities you love
Animal facts (ocean creatures, endangered species, dinosaurs)
Mythology and folklore from different cultures
Personal
FAQ about your hometown or country
Your own CV/portfolio (turn yourself into a searchable knowledge base!)
Your study notes from a course you are taking
Feel free to come up with your own topic -- the more passionate you are about it, the better your project will be!

Step-by-Step Instructions
Step 1: Choose Your Topic (5 min)
Pick something you are genuinely interested in. You will need to find or write at least 10 text passages about it. The topic should be broad enough that you can cover different aspects of it.

Ask yourself: Can I write (or find) 10 different paragraphs about different subtopics within this theme?

Step 2: Collect Your Documents (30 min)
Gather your source material:

Write your own text OR copy from Wikipedia, textbooks, articles, etc.
Each document should be 1-3 paragraphs long (roughly 100-500 words)
Aim for at least 10 documents covering different aspects of your topic
Save them as the DOCUMENTS list in your app.py file
Tips for good documents:

Cover different subtopics (breadth is better than depth for search)
Include specific facts, names, dates, or numbers where relevant
Write in clear, informative language
If copying from the web, make sure to note your sources for the report
Example: If your topic is "Italian Cuisine," your documents might cover: pasta types, pizza history, regional differences, olive oil, famous chefs, wine pairing, desserts, cooking techniques, Italian food culture, and a famous recipe.

Step 3: Set Up Your Project (10 min)
Create a project folder with the following files:

my-rag-app/
    app.py                 # Your Streamlit application
    requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
    render.yaml            # Render deployment configuration
    .gitignore             # Files to exclude from Git
requirements.txt should contain:

streamlit
langchain
langchain-community
langchain-text-splitters
chromadb
sentence-transformers
render.yaml should contain:

services:
  - type: web
    name: my-rag-app
    runtime: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0
    envVars:
      - key: PYTHON_VERSION
        value: "3.11"
.gitignore should contain:

__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
chroma_db/
For app.py, start from the starter template provided in the course materials (see the streamlit-starter folder).

Step 4: Customize Your App (60 min)
Starting from the starter template, make the following changes:

Replace the DOCUMENTS list with your own texts (at least 10)
Update the app title, icon, and descriptions to match your topic
Choose a chunking strategy and set your chunk_size and chunk_overlap
Think about what makes sense for your documents
Shorter chunks (100-200 chars) = more precise but less context
Longer chunks (500-1000 chars) = more context but less precise
You will need to explain your choice in the report!
(Optional) Add extra pages: About, Statistics, Visualization
(Optional) Customize the styling with colors, layout, or images
Important: Test different chunking strategies! Try at least two different chunk_size values and see how the search results change. This will give you something interesting to write about in your report.

Step 5: Test Locally (15 min)
Run your application locally to make sure everything works:

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
Your app should open in the browser at http://localhost:8501.

Test checklist:

[ ] App loads without errors
[ ] Home page displays correctly with your topic information
[ ] Search page accepts a query and returns results
[ ] Results are relevant to the query
[ ] Try at least 5 different search queries
[ ] Try a query that is NOT about your topic -- what happens?
Take a screenshot of your working app for the report.

Step 6: Push to GitHub (10 min)
First, create a new repository on GitHub:

Go to github.comLinks to an external site. and sign in
Click the "+" button (top right) and select "New repository"
Name it something descriptive (e.g., italian-cuisine-rag)
Set it to Public
Do NOT initialize with a README (we will push from local)
Click "Create repository"
Then, push your code from the terminal:

git init
git add app.py requirements.txt render.yaml .gitignore
git commit -m "My RAG knowledge base app"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Replace YOUR_USERNAME and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Step 7: Deploy to Render (15 min)
Go to render.comLinks to an external site. and sign in with your GitHub account
From the dashboard, click "New +" and select "Web Service"
Find and connect your repository from the list
Render should automatically detect your render.yaml configuration
Click "Create Web Service"
Wait for the build to complete (this may take 5-10 minutes)
Once deployed, click the URL at the top of the page to see your live app
Test your live URL to make sure everything works
Save your Render URL -- you will need it for the report!

Note: The free Render tier "sleeps" your app after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first visit after sleep takes about 30-60 seconds to wake up. This is normal.

Step 8: Write Your Report (45 min)
See the Report Requirements section below for details.

Report Requirements
Submit a PDF report (2-3 pages) containing the following:

Page 1: Application Overview
Title: Your app name and topic
Topic description: Why you chose this topic (2-3 sentences)
Screenshot: A screenshot of your running application showing the search page with results
Links:
GitHub repository URL
Render deployment URL
Page 2: Technical Details
Documents: How many documents you included and where you sourced them (self-written, Wikipedia, textbooks, etc.)
Chunking strategy: This is the most important part!
What chunk_size and chunk_overlap did you use?
Why did you choose those values?
Did you try multiple strategies? What differences did you notice?
Give a concrete example: "When I searched for X, with chunk_size=200 I got Y, but with chunk_size=500 I got Z"
Embedding model: Which model you used (default: all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and any notes about it
Interesting findings: Any surprising search results? Queries that worked unexpectedly well or poorly? Edge cases you discovered?
Page 3 (Optional): Reflections & Extensions
What did you learn from this project?
What would you improve if you had more time?
Any ideas for extending the app (e.g., adding an LLM for answer generation, supporting file uploads, adding more documents)?

Troubleshooting Guide
Here are solutions to common problems you might encounter:

"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'"
Your requirements.txt is missing a package. Add the missing module name to requirements.txt and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
"Build failed on Render"
Check the build logs on the Render dashboard. The most common cause is a missing package in requirements.txt. Read the error message carefully -- it usually tells you exactly which package is missing.

"App crashes with MemoryError"
The free Render tier has limited RAM (512 MB). To fix this:

Use fewer or shorter documents
Use a smaller embedding model
Reduce your chunk_size to create fewer total chunks
"Search returns irrelevant results"
Try reducing your chunk_size (smaller chunks = more precise matching)
Make sure your documents actually cover the topic well and contain the keywords/concepts you are searching for
Check that your documents are not too short (very short chunks may lack enough context for good embeddings)
"App is very slow on first load"
This is normal! The first load downloads the embedding model (~90 MB). After that, it is cached. On the free Render tier, the app also "sleeps" after 15 minutes of inactivity, so the first visit after sleep takes 30-60 seconds.

"Git push fails"
Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first (it must already exist)
Check that the remote URL is correct: git remote -v
If you get an authentication error, make sure you are logged into GitHub in your terminal (use gh auth login or a personal access token)
"Streamlit run says 'command not found'"
Make sure you installed the dependencies first:

pip install -r requirements.txt
If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated.
